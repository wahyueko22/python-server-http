# http-server

An HTTP server is a software application that serves web content to clients (typically web browsers) over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
This project is creating an http server in Python from scratch. Basically, an http is a protocol that sits on top of a TCP connection.
It's better that all of you understand the concept of the OSI 7 layer, at least from layer 4 until layer 7. Usually,Â  each operating system will provide a TCP socket connection by default, and then we only need a little tweaking to build an HTTP connection on top of the TCP connection.
On this current version is only focus on http method get and http method POST.
